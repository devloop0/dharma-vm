###General Information

The karma programming language needed a virtual machine to run, so this is an implementation that runs the karma-lang bytecode.
Currently, the plan is to just feed karma-lang bytecode directly from the compiler to the interpreter, but in the future, it can be expected that the output can be saved to a file.
The bytecode generated by the karma programming language is minimal, meaning that all the checks necessary to ensure valid code are already embedded in the source code.
This will most likely be changed in the (near?) future, as these checks may not only be faulty, but significantly increase the code size of the karma programming language.

All commits to the karma programming language's compiler and additions to the core language will be done in my [other repository](https://github.com/devloop0/karma-lang).
Thank you for taking the time to look at this page, I really appreciate.
